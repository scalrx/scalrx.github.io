## Blog Format

Hey, everyone!

Thanks for checking out my blog. This is mainly just a test post to help with setting up and demonstrating familiarity of using $\LaTeX$ in Jekyll. 

$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty{1\over n^2} = {\pi^2\over 6}$$

$$\int_0^1x\,dx = {1\over2}.$$

Hope you'll bear with me and stick around while I sort through the getting-started stages of my website. Thanks!
