Have you ever *wished there was an app for that*? Whatever it may, I have wished just that for numerous things. Herein, I hope to make my app dreams finally come true, **myself**!

I am a mathematician and hobbyist programmer, and hence by no means a professional app developer. Indeed, my programming skills may be somewhat laughable. However, you can follow my journey of learning how to produce my dream apps right here on my blog!

I hope whatever creations I devise are ones you can enjoy too. Thanks for coming by, and hope to see you again!
